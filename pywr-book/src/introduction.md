# Introduction

Welcome to the Pywr book!
Pywr is an open-source network resource allocation model.
This book is a collection of documentation and tutorials for using Pywr.
It should be read alongside the Pywr API documentation.

# What is Pywr?

Pywr is a Rust crate and Python package for building and running water resource models.
It allows users to construct models of water systems using a network of nodes and links, and other data.
The model can then be used to simulate the operation of a water system, and to evaluate the performance of the system under different scenarios.

This version is a major update to the original Pywr model, which was written in Python and Cython.
The new version is written in Rust, and uses Python bindings to expose the functionality to Python.
