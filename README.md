<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

Pywr-1.x is a Python library which utilises Cython for performance. Over time this has resulted in a "core"
set of data structures and objects that are written in Cython to gain maximum performance. Cython has the nice
benefit of making it easy to extend that core functionality using regular Python. However, the border between what
is Python and what is Cython is a bit blurred and not well designed in certain places.

One option for the future development of Pywr (e.g. Pywr-2.x) would be a more explicit separation between the compute
"core" and higher level functionality. Rust is a candidate for writing that core largely independent of Python, and
possibly offers the benefits of (1) greater performance than Cython, and (2) easier maintenance in the future.

### Requirements

Any major revision to Pywr will have the following feature requirements:

- Retain the "Parameter" system from Pywr-1.x - this is core functionality that makes Pywr really flexible.
- Extendable in Python space.
- An improved approach for outputting data and metrics.
- Better error handling.
- Cross-platform.
- Faster!
- Strong input file (JSON) schema.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

### Getting started

This repository contains a version of Clp using Git submodules. In order to build those submodules
must be initialised first.

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Rust is required for installation of the Python extension. To create a Python development installation
requires first compiling the Rust library and then the Python extension. The following example uses
a virtual environment to install the Python dependencies, compile the Pywr extension and run the Pywr Python CLI.

```bash
python -m venv .venv # create a new virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate # activate the virtual environment (linux)
# .venv\Scripts\activate # activate the virtual environment (windows)
pip install maturin  # install maturin for building the Python extension
maturin develop # compile the Pywr Python extension
python -m pywr  # run the Pywr Python CLI
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->

## Usage

### Rust CLI

A basic command line interface is included such that you can use this version of Pywr without Python.
This CLI is in the `pywr-cli` crate.

To see the CLI commands available run the following:

```bash
cargo run -p pywr-cli -- --help
```

To run a Pywr v2 model use the following:

```bash
cargo run -p pywr-cli -- run tests/models/simple1.json
```

### Python CLI

If the Python extension has been compiled using the above instructions a model can be run using the basic Python
CLI.

```bash
python -m pywr run tests/models/simple1.json
```

## Porting a Pywr v1.x model to v2.x

This version of Pywr is not backward compatible with Pywr v1.x. One of the major reasons for this version is the
lack of a strong schema in the Pywr v1.x JSON files. Pywr v2.x uses an updated JSON schema that is defined in this
repository. Therefore, v1.x JSON files must be converted to the v2.x JSON schema. This conversion can be undertaken
manually, but there is also a work-in-progress conversion tool. The conversion tool uses a v1.x schema defined in
the [pywr-schema](https://github.com/pywr/pywr-schema) project.

**Please note that conversion from Pywr v1.x to v2.x is experimental and not all features of Pywr are implemented
in `pywr-schema` or have been implemented in Pywr v2.x yet. Due to the changes between these versions it is very
likely an automatic conversion will not completely convert your model, and it _WILL_ require manual testing and
checking.**

```bash
cargo run --no-default-features -- convert /path/to/my/v1.x/model.json
```

Feedback on porting models is very welcome, so please open an issue with any questions or problems.

<!-- CRATES -->

## Crates

This repository contains the following crates:

### Pywr-core

A low-level Rust library for constructing network models. This crate interfaces with linear program solvers.

Feature flags:

| Feature    | Description                                      | Default |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `highs`    | Enable the HiGHS LP solver.                      | False   |
| `ipm-ocl`  | Enable the OpenCL IPM solver (requires nightly). | False   |
| `ipm-simd` | Enable the AVX IPM solver (requires nightly).    | False   |

### Pywr-schema

A Rust library for validating Pywr JSON files against a schema, and then building a model from the schema
using `pywr-core`.

Feature flags:

| Feature | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Default |
|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `core`  | Enable building models from the schema with `pywr-core`. This feature is enabled by default, but requires a lot of dependencies. If you only require schema validation and manipulation consider building this crate with `default-features = false` | True    |

### Pywr-cli

A command line interface for running Pywr models.

### Pywr-python

A Python extension (and package) for constructing and running Pywr models.
